# Fan Health Diagnostic System

An AI-powered system that uses a CNN model to analyze audio files and predict fan health status (Bearing, Motor, or Blade failure).

## Live Demo
You can access the live application here:

## How to use
1. Upload a .wav or .mp3 audio file of a fan.
2. The system will analyze the sound pattern.
3. View the diagnostic results on the dashboard.
## Demo Audio Samples

The following audio files demonstrate distinct system outputs:

| Audio | Model Output |
|-----|-------------|
| normal.wav | Normal fan operation |
| bearing_fault.wav | Bearing wear detected |
| blade_imbalance.wav | Blade imbalance detected |
| motor_hum.wav | Motor humming fault |

These files were selected from the trained dataset to showcase different fault classifications.
